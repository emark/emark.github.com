## Build/Lint/Test Commands

This is a **static HTML site** - there is no build system, no test framework, and no linting configured.

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages from the `main` branch. Simply push changes to `main` and GitHub Pages will deploy them.

### Local Development

To preview the site locally, you can use any static file server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Validation

No automated validation is configured. For HTML validation, you may manually use:
- W3C HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/

### Testing

This project has **no test framework** and **no automated tests**. Testing is performed manually by:
- Opening the site locally and verifying functionality
- Using browser developer tools to check for console errors
- Validating HTML at https://validator.w3.org/

When making changes, manually verify:
- Page loads without console errors
- Dark/light theme toggle works
- All links are functional
- Site is responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop

## Code Style Guidelines

Since this is a static HTML site with minimal JavaScript, follow these guidelines:

### HTML

- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Keep attributes in alphabetical order within tags
- Use double quotes for attribute values
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Self-closing tags should have a space before `/>` (e.g., `<br />`)
- Bootstrap classes are used throughout - follow Bootstrap conventions

### CSS

- Bootstrap CSS is loaded from `assets/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css` (minified, do not edit)
- Custom CSS is inline in `<style>` tags within `<head>`
- Follow Bootstrap's CSS class naming conventions
- Use existing Bootstrap utility classes before creating custom styles

### JavaScript

- JavaScript is in `assets/js/color-modes.js`
- Use strict mode (`'use strict'`)
- Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Keep code minimal - only theme toggle functionality
- Bootstrap JS is loaded from `assets/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js` (minified)
- Use descriptive variable names (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for constants)
- Wrap code in IIFE or use ES modules to avoid global scope pollution
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch for any DOM manipulation
- Use console.warn instead of console.error for non-critical issues

### File Paths

- Use relative paths starting with `./` for same-directory references
- Example: `<script src="./assets/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>`
- Example: `<img src="./media/profile.jpg" />`

### Accessibility

- Always include `alt` attributes for images
- Use semantic HTML for proper screen reader support
- Include `aria-label` on interactive elements
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines

### External Resources

The site uses these external CDNs:
- Bootstrap Icons: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.13.1/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css`
- Google Analytics (gtag.js)

Do not add new external dependencies without justification.

### Images

- Profile image: `media/profile.jpg` - circular, ~200x200px recommended
- Certificates: PDF format in `cert/` directory

### Versioning

- Version is displayed in the header (currently `v.1.0`)
- Update version number when making significant changes

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new certificate

1. Add the PDF file to the `cert/` directory
2. Add a new link in the Certificates section of `index.html`

### Updating profile information

Edit the relevant sections in `index.html`:
- About me: lines 229-241
- Education: accordion section
- Work experience: accordion section
- Links: in the Links section

### Changing theme colors

- Theme colors are defined in the `<style>` block in `<head>` (lines 31-104)
- Primary color: `#712cf9` (Bootstrap violet)
- To change, update `--bd-violet-bg` and related CSS variables

### Adding a new accordion section

Copy the existing accordion-item structure and:
1. Change `id="flush-collapseX"` to a unique ID
2. Update `data-bs-target` to match
3. Update `data-bs-parent` to point to the accordion parent

## Notes

- The HTML was originally generated by Astro v5.13.2 (as noted in meta tag) but is now manually maintained
- The site uses Bootstrap 5.3 examples starter template as a base
- Google Analytics tracking ID: G-SPHQQ2M88P
